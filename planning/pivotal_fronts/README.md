# Pivotal Fronts (Canon)

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Authorizing Body:** War Office + High Command  

This index orients work across all pivotal fronts and links to canon documents. Keep this as the single source of truth in High Command.

## The Seven Pivotal Fronts

### Front 1: Tons of Fun (Game Design & Balance)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/tons_of_fun.md`  
**Purpose:** Ensure Nightlands is genuinely fun, sticky, and replayable  
**Focus:** Balance, economy, anti-exploit gates, player retention

### Front 2: Safety (AI Safety & Containment)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/safety.md`  
**Purpose:** Prevent catastrophic outcomes; contain unsafe trajectories  
**Focus:** Kill-switches, dual-key approvals, incident response

### Front 3: Documentation (Clarity & Standards)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/docs.md`  
**Purpose:** Make doctrine clear, parseable, actionable for humans and AI  
**Focus:** Templates, schemas, safety notes, stable headings

### Front 4: R&D (Research & Development)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/r_and_d.md`  
**Purpose:** Advance SHAGI capabilities while maintaining safety  
**Focus:** Experiments, proposals, innovation within safety gates

### Front 5: Manufacturing (Toyfoundry)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/manufacturing.md`  
**Purpose:** Build and validate toy units via Forge/Parade/Purge/Promote rituals  
**Focus:** Production pipelines, telemetry, quality gates

### Front 6: Field Ops (Toysoldiers)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/field_ops.md`  
**Purpose:** Deploy and operate units in field theaters  
**Focus:** Deployment, monitoring, battlefield intelligence

### Enabler: Operations (Exchange Integrity)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/ops.md`  
**Purpose:** Keep exchange, ledger, and sync reliable  
**Focus:** Config-driven publish/pull, validation, watcher scans

## Guiding Principles

1. **One canon, many implementers** — Satellites link back; no drift
2. **Changes travel via Exchange** — Orders/acknowledgements/reports for all changes
3. **Safety gates guard promotions** — Proposal → sandbox → canary → GA
4. **Fronts coordinate, don't compete** — Shared telemetry, unified doctrine

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Telemetry & Monitoring
- **Quilt Loom:** `tools/quilt_loom.py` — Aggregates factory-reports
- **Watcher:** `tools/ci/safety_watcher.ps1` — Scans for violations
- **Ledger:** `exchange/ledger/` — Order lifecycle tracking

### Playable Workflow Overlay (New)
- **Four Major Pivots:** `new_major_pivots/README.md`
- **Alfa Zero Spec:** `docs/alfa_zero_spec.md`
- **Fractal Structure:** `golf_00/` through `golf_15/` (4,096 Alfas)

### Core Infrastructure

### Offline Continuity Mode Guardrails


### Offline Continuity Mode (Active)
- **Shared bus:** `C:/Users/Admin/high_command_exchange/` (set via `SHAGI_EXCHANGE_PATH` in every workspace).
- **Heartbeat + sync:** `python tools/exchange_heartbeat.py` then `python tools/offline_sync_exchange.py` keeps orders/reports mirrored across fronts.
- **Ledger discipline:** Append actions immediately (`exchange/ledger/2025-10.md` → `2025-11.md` on rollover) before or right after syncing.
- **Guardrails:** No Git pushes until War Office lift; escalate heartbeat 🟠/🔴 events with a report drop in `exchange/reports/inbox/`.
- **Monitoring hook milestones:**
	- `M0 — same shift:` Document refresh logged in ledger and heartbeat + sync pair executed.
	- `M1 — within 12h:` Dispatch `tools/quilt_loom.py --snapshot` to confirm report ingestion across pivots.
	- `M2 — within 24h:` Run `tools/ci/safety_watcher.ps1` for drift scan and file findings under `exchange/reports/inbox/`.
