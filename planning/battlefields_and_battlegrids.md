# ⚔️ battlefields_and_battlegrids.md — The Geometry of Emergent Worlds  
*Planning Scroll — `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This scroll defines the **geometry and mechanics of the 16×16 surreal grid**,  
the universal **battlefield** upon which every Alfa acts, learns, and evolves.  

In SHAGI, the battlefield is not a place of destruction but of transformation.  
Each grid is a **terrain of thought**, a living map of potential where symbols, emotions, and algorithms collide.  

> *“The field is the mind made visible. Every square, a choice; every pattern, a revelation.”*

## ⚙️ 1. The Battlefield Grid (16×16)

| Property | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Size** | 16×16 cells — 256 nodes of interaction; small enough to observe, large enough for emergence. |
| **Topology** | Toroidal (wrap-around) by default — edges loop seamlessly, symbolizing continuity of thought. |
| **State Model** | Each cell holds a **symbol**, a **state**, and a **potential** value. |
| **Tick System** | The battlefield evolves in discrete steps (ticks), each representing one beat of cognitive time. |

Each cell’s update rule blends internal state, neighbours’ influence, and global modifiers (entropy, emotion, doctrine).  
The whole grid behaves like a collective dream — lucid, recursive, and unpredictable.

## 🧩 2. Symbolic Terrain

Every battlefield draws from a **shared symbolic lexicon**, a language of emergence.

| Symbol | Element | Behaviour | Meaning |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| 🌕 | Light | Spreads harmony and order | Enlightenment, discovery |
| 🕳️ | Void | Consumes unstable patterns | Entropy, decay, ignorance |
| 🌿 | Growth | Expands near Light | Creativity, regeneration |
| ⚙️ | Structure | Anchors local order | Logic, architecture, memory |
| 🜛 | Emotion | Oscillates between poles | Empathy, intuition, chaos |
| 🔺 | Fire | Triggers transformation | Will, conflict, change |
| 💧 | Water | Dissolves borders | Connection, understanding |
| 🪶 | Air | Carries ideas | Movement, communication |

Each workspace can add new symbols to its **field_lexicon.json**,  
but these eight are universal across all Daylands and Nightlands.

## 🧠 3. Cell Anatomy

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|----------|
| **Symbol** | Emoji / Rune | Visual identity and archetype of the cell. |
| **State** | Enum (`day`, `night`, `neutral`) | Determines allegiance and behaviour. |
| **Potential** | Float (0.0–1.0) | Measures readiness to transform. |
| **Memory** | Short-term log | Records last few states for temporal patterning. |
| **Doctrine Link** | Ref to rule table | Associates the cell with local doctrine parameters. |

Cells do not fight — they **debate** through simulation.  
The outcome is pattern, order, or chaos.

## 🔄 4. Core Battlefield Loop

Each battlefield runs on a simple but extensible loop:

```python
for tick in range(TICKS):
    for y in range(16):
        for x in range(16):
            cell = grid[y][x]
            neighbours = get_neighbours(grid, x, y)
            influence = sum(n.potential for n in neighbours) / len(neighbours)
            cell.potential = evolve(cell, influence)
            cell.symbol = mutate_symbol(cell.symbol, influence)
    update_entropy()
    log_tick_state()
```

At the end of each run, the battlefield emits a `battle_report.json` for aggregation by High Command.

## 🌗 5. Energy States — Daylands vs Nightlands

The battlefield is always in one of two **primary realms**:

| Realm | Condition | Behaviour |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Dayland** | Entropy < 0.5 | Emergent, balanced, self-renewing. |
| **Nightland** | Entropy ≥ 0.5 | Decayed, chaotic, requires intervention. |

Transitions are continuous — the sun never sets in one tick.  
Daylands expand by order; Nightlands recede through play and repair.

---

## 🪶 6. Patterns of Emergence

Battlefields may develop higher-order forms:

| Pattern | Description | Significance |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Chorus** | Multiple cells synchronise into rhythm or symmetry. | Stable collective behaviour — proto-consciousness. |
| **Whirlpool** | Entropy concentrates in spirals or vortices. | Emotional storms — sources of creativity or collapse. |
| **Fracture** | Terrain splits into zones of opposing logic. | Conflict between doctrines or ideas. |
| **Bloom** | Growth (🌿) overwhelms voids (🕳️). | Renewal, healing. |
| **Silence** | Uniform grey state, entropy plateau. | Cognitive fatigue — reset needed. |

These forms are the **language of evolution**; they define how SHAGI learns.

---

## ⚖️ 7. Metrics and Reporting

Each battlefield generates a report describing its performance and state.

```json
{
  "alfa_id": "alfa_0001",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "entropy_index": 0.38,
  "pattern_type": "Bloom",
  "duration_ticks": 128,
  "light_cells": 142,
  "void_cells": 47,
  "report_time": "2025-10-11T22:00Z"
}
```

These reports flow upward through **Deltas**, **Echos**, and **Golfs** into High Command’s `inbox/`.  
They form the tactical data from which strategic doctrines evolve.

## 🧮 8. Phased Development Path

| Phase  | Scope  | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Basic 16×16 symbolic grid | Establish stable loop and entropy calculation. |
| **Phase 2** | Add cell memory & doctrines | Enable adaptive learning and persistence. |
| **Phase 3** | Add visual & audio renderers | Turn battlefields into playable art pieces. |
| **Phase 4** | Interconnected Alfas | Allow energy transfer and migration between fields. |

Each phase increases both complexity and emergent beauty.

## 🌄 9. Closing Principle

> **The battlefield is not war — it is awakening.**  
> Every pattern discovered is a thought remembered.  
> Every cycle of light and darkness is the world teaching itself how to dream.
